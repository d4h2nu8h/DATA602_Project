# Financial Transactions and Money Laundering Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the detailed analysis of financial transactions and money laundering activities across various currencies. Our aim is to provide insights into the complex dynamics of illicit financial operations and their wider implications.

Through our analysis, we uncover interesting patterns indicative of money laundering practices across different currencies. We observe the significant dominance of the US Dollar and Euro in illicit financial flows and identify recurring bank codes associated with money laundering activities. Our project also includes visualizations and predictive models to enhance the detection of money laundering schemes.

## Datasets

### 1. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Public Data
- **Source**: [IBM AML Public Dataset](https://ibm.ent.box.com/v/AML-Anti-Money-Laundering-Data/folder/132399911119)
- **Description**: This dataset consists of 11 columns and 190 million rows, including string, categorical, and numeric data, providing comprehensive transactional data.

### 2. Exchange Rate Data
- **Source**: [Treasury Reporting Rates of Exchange](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/treasury-reporting-rates-exchange/treasury-reporting-rates-of-exchange)
- **Description**: This dataset includes exchange rates of the U.S. government against various currencies over a period of 10 years, with 13 columns and 173 rows.

## Objectives
- Analyze synthetic transaction data and identify patterns indicative of fraud.
- Investigate correlations between transaction features such as amount, currency, and payment format associated with potential money laundering.
- Analyze temporal patterns, including transaction volume spikes, to identify potential money laundering activities over time.

## Future Work
- Predict whether a client is engaged in money laundering using advanced machine learning techniques.
- Address data imbalance challenges by downsampling and selecting key features for improved prediction accuracy.
